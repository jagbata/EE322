# 2/12/23 -Super Bowl Sunday

Today is Superbowl Sunday, but I wanted to do a little bit of work before the festivities

I read through lesson 1 and lesson 2 earlier, there was a lot in lesson 1 that I had never seen, but at least the least the _Lab 1_ stuff was familiar

I had done pi setup before. The Lesson 2 also had some stuff I had seen before but it was helpful to get a refresher and for some topics such as the 
LXDE, I learned some *new* info.

Included will be some pictures from the terminal portion of the lab. 

#### hostname
This command tells you the name of the machine you are using

#### env
This command spits a bunch information regarding the files on this computer and various other paths

#### ps
This command lets you check the status of certain processes

#### pwd
Tells you the path directory of the folder you are currently in

#### git clone..
Clones into Kevin Lu's iot folder on GitHub

#### cd iot
opens it 
#### ls 
list
#### cd 
This may be how its done on Mac, but to go up a folder in Windows you type cd..

#### df
Tells you how much space you have

#### mkdir demo
Make a folder called demo
#### cd demo
Open the folder

#### nano file
create a file called file and open it with nano editor

It is worth noting that for the file to be actually created, you have to add stuff to it and save the file
#### cat file
Print what the file says

#### cp file file1
Copies contents of *file* into a file called *file1*
If that file does not yet exist, it creates a new file

#### mv file file2
Renames *file* as *file2*
#### rm file2
Deletes file2

#### clear
Clears the terminal

#### man uname
This does not exist on windows. Equivalent is uname 

#### uname -a
Lists some info about operating system, version and time settings

#### ipconfig
Displays network configurations 

#### ping localhost
Checks how stable the connection is between this computer and the local host

#### netstat
Displays networks and network statistics

Below is another screen shot I took. 
When I ran the *netstat* command, it ran for a while but that is because I am currently in an apartment building so it makes sense that there were a lot of networks around me. I did not include all that info since it was a lot.
