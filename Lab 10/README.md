# Lab 10 4/10

I wanted to do this lab over our Easter "break" but I was pretty busy at home so I could not

I ran the *hash_value.py* function twice and got different values for:

hash value for Python, hash value for a tuple of vowels, and the hash value for an object of person

Here is the image of my [First Run](https://github.com/jagbata/EE322/blob/main/Lab%2010/hashrun1.jpg)

and the [Second](https://github.com/jagbata/EE322/blob/main/Lab%2010/hashrun2.jpg)

I ran *snakecoin.py* and it added 20 blocks, each with their own hash. 

Next I ran *snakecoin-server-full-code.py* with the two terminals and I was able to see a publication with an index, timestamp, hash and some other things

It gave me a little trouble but I was able to successfully run the next parts. The problem I was having was that I was trying to view the wrong port. I should have been trying to view port 5000 and I was *trying* to view 8000. 

After that got sorted out, I was able to input messages and see [them](https://github.com/jagbata/EE322/blob/main/Lab%2010/blockchainapp.jpg) displayed

I know they are almost 12 hours apart, but Mondays are very long for me and I wanted to finish it today. Luckily for me my laptop did not turn off at any point or I might have had to restart that portion of the lab.
