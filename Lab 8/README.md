# Lab 8

I wanted to get ahead and start Lab 8, but I need stuff from Lab 7 to complete it. Unfortunately, I was unable to properly complete lab 7 so I guess this will have to wait 

## 4/2/23
Yesterday I was able to complete lab 7 so I can now move on with this lab.

I downloaded the CSV file and put it in the correct folder and moved on to start running the commands. I downloaded all the necessary files and tried to run the **py** command

The first time I tried to run the *plt_final.py* I received this error:

It took me a minute to decipher this error, but when I checked the slide instructions, the part that said *customized plot titles* told me what I needed to do

I opened the *plt_final.py* file in notepad and changed anywhere that said **CPU Usage %** to *CPU Usage* (that is what my title was)
and anywhere that saud **Temperature C** to *Available Memory*. 

Of course there is very little relationship to be had with *CPU Usage* and *Available Memory*, but I did not have a sensor and was just using my laptop. 

I was able to see the graphs that were made, and while *these* may have no meaning, this part was useful in terms of seeing how you can extract data from a **.csv** file to make graphs.

Even though they don't really make sense, I still have uploaded the graphs, just for documentation purposes
