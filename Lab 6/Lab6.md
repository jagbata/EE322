# Lab 6

Today we did Lab 6 in class

The installation process for node was not too bad, but my computer was at very low battery so it took some time for it to download

**node -v**

This tells you what version of node you are running on *v18.14.2*

**npm -v**

This tells you what version the node package manager is running *9.5.0*

**node -h**

This displays all the different commands you can enter if you want to do a specific task

**node hello-world.js**

This command prompts the server to start running and if you go to that address, it prints *Hello World!*

**node hello.js**

This commands is running a server too, but at a different address. It prints *Hello World!*


**node http.js**

I don't know what this does, nothing appears and I have to ctrl+C to clear
I asked a friend for help and he told me to type *localhost:8080* in the search bar and it told me how often the page was refreshed, both on the page itself and in the terminal

# Lab 6B #

This part deals with using Mustache

**cat say_hello.mustacehe**

prints *Hello, {{to}}!*

**cat say_hello.py**

This seems like a logic breakdown of what is happening within the file

**python3 say_hello.py**

This prints this:

Which is some text and then some info about the file
