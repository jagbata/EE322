# Lab 6

Today we did Lab 6 in class

The installation process for node was not too bad, but my computer was at very low battery so it took some time for it to download

**node -v**

This tells you what version of node you are running on *v18.14.2*

**npm -v**

This tells you what version the node package manager is running *9.5.0*

**node -h**

This displays all the different commands you can enter if you want to do a specific task

**node hello-world.js**

This command prompts the server to start running and tells me what ip number it is running at

**node hello.js**

This commands is running a server too, but at a different address

**node http.js**

I don't know what this does, nothing appears and I have to ctrl+C to clear
