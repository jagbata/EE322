# 2/12/23 -Super Bowl Sunday

Today is Superbowl Sunday, but I wanted to do a little bit of work before the festivities

I read through lesson 1 and lesson 2 earlier, there was a lot in lesson 1 that I had never seen, but at least the least the _Lab 1_ stuff was familiar

I had done pi setup before. The Lesson 2 also had some stuff I had seen before but it was helpful to get a refresher and for some topics such as the 
LXDE, I learned some *new* info.

Included will be some pictures from the terminal portion of the lab.

Below is another screen shot I took. 
When I ran the *netstat* command, it ran for a while but that is because I am currently in an apartment building so it makes sense that there were a lot of networks around me. I did not include all that info since it was a lot.
