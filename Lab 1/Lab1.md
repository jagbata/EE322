# Lab 1 GHDL 


To start off, the first problem I had occurred with the GTK download.
It kept downloading a raspberry pi thing, and I don't *think* it's supposed to be that. 


**Update**: I was downloading the wrong file this whole time

After getting the correct file, there was an issue where the terminal could not recognize the ghdl command. The solution to that is the picture below

## 2/6/23 Continuation

Previously, I came across an error that I could not resolve and I ended up giving up because even my friends did not know what was wrong. 

I went to see Prof Lu today and he offered that I may not be in the correct directory.

After solving this issue, I can now run the simple commands properly
